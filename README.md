## Features 

### Design

- The color palette for the website was generated from [My Color](https://mycolor.space/). 

![Color palette](/README-images/color-gradient.png)

- I have used the colors #75BA75 and #1E8F83 for the background.
- I wanted a smooth gradient effect for the page, and found how to implement it here [Gradient reference](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp)
- A white text color is used to give a nice contrast against the green background. 
- I wanted to have an opaque background behind the text, so the background image could still be used with white text.
