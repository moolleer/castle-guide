            <h2>Skåne castles</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>There are around 170 castles and manors in Skåne.
                Castles served as defense facilities for several centuries. 
                Skåne has been particularly exposed to conflicts through constant battles between Sweden and Denmark. 
                There was also a rich nobility that built many of the castles in Skåne that still exist today.
                </p>
            <h2>Why visit a castle?</h2>
